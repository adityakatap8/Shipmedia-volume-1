With the COVID pandemic, the event was held outdoors and audience members were seated in pods. The best thing about Tribeca is that we got to hear the film directors share their vision before the film and all the work they put into telling their story.",

They act like elitists and fans are just little peons to them, not worth any time or effort. I did not have a great experience at the festival and it felt like being a fan of RD was this huge no-no. Before I went to the festival this year, I didn't get a response with a few simple questions. I emailed again and the person who answered a week later seemed annoyed. Won't be going again.",
